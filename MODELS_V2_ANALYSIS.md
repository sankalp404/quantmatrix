## 🔄 **MIGRATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Preserve Current Functionality**
```python
# Keep your current models working
from backend.models import * # Current models
from backend.models_v2 import * # New V2 models

# Run both systems in parallel during transition
```

### **Phase 2: Data Migration** 
```python
# Map current data to V2 structure
Current Strategy → V2 Strategy (+ default user)
Current Signals → V2 Signals (+ user assignment)
Current Market Data → V2 Market Data (enhanced)
```

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features**
```python
# Add new V2 capabilities
✅ User registration/authentication
✅ Multi-user strategy isolation  
✅ Enhanced Discord per-user webhooks
✅ Advanced backtesting framework
✅ Comprehensive performance analytics
```

## 💡 **KEY ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **1. Cleaner Organization**
```
Current: Single models/ directory with mixed concerns
V2: Organized by domain with clear separation
├── users.py (authentication & preferences)
├── accounts.py (brokerage accounts)  
├── instruments.py (universal symbol catalog)
├── positions.py (current holdings)
├── transactions.py (trade history)
├── tax_lots.py (cost basis tracking)
├── market_data.py (comprehensive market data)
├── strategies.py (strategy definitions & execution)
├── signals.py (signal generation & notifications)
└── audit.py (complete audit trail)
```

### **2. Enhanced Relationships**
```python
# Current: Limited relationships
Strategy → Signals → Notifications

# V2: Complete graph
User → Strategy → StrategyRun → Signal → Notification
    → Account → Position → Transaction → TaxLot
    → AlertRule → DiscordWebhook
    → Instrument → PriceData → TechnicalIndicators
```

### **3. Production-Grade Constraints**
```python
# Current: Basic validation
# V2: Comprehensive business rules
CheckConstraint('position_size_pct > 0 AND position_size_pct <= 100')
CheckConstraint('signal_strength >= 0 AND signal_strength <= 1')
CheckConstraint('quantity != 0')
UniqueConstraint('user_id', 'strategy_name')
```
