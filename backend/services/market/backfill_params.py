"""Backfill parameter helpers.

We expose operator-facing knobs like `days` (roughly "trading days of coverage desired"),
but providers don't support "last N trading days" directly. We therefore:

- choose a coarse provider `period` (calendar range) when the provider supports it (e.g. yfinance)
- always apply a hard `max_bars` bound to the returned dataframe so downstream compute is stable
- include a buffer so indicators like SMA200 (and other rolling windows) have enough history

    Notes:
    - `days` is interpreted as "roughly trading days", not calendar days.
    - `period` is a provider request hint (calendar range). Providers differ:
      - yfinance honors period strings like "1y", "2y", "5y", "max"
      - FMP daily historical endpoint returns its full history; period is effectively ignored
      - TwelveData uses outputsize; period is effectively ignored
    - `max_bars` is always enforced after fetch (newest-first), so behavior is consistent.
