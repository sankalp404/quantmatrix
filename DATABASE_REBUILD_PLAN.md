# QuantMatrix Database Rebuild Plan
## From Current Chaos to Production-Grade Multi-User Platform

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### Critical Issues Identified
- **55 Holdings with Tax Lot Discrepancies**: 37,964 shares total discrepancy
- **Systemic Data Duplication**: ~2x tax lots vs actual holdings across all stocks
- **No Data Integrity Constraints**: Phantom records, orphaned relationships
- **Single User Architecture**: No multi-tenancy support
- **No Authentication System**: Production-grade auth missing
- **Ad-hoc Schema Evolution**: Accumulated technical debt

### Data Sources Working/Broken
✅ **TastyTrade**: Historical data sync working well  
✅ **IBKR Holdings**: Current positions accurate  
❌ **IBKR Historical**: Missing recent transactions (TQQQ sale)  
❌ **IBKR Options**: Poor sync quality, not recommended for trading  
❌ **Tax Lots**: Massive duplication across all symbols  

---

## 🏗️ **NEW SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE**

### Design Principles
1. **Multi-User First**: Built for scalability from day one
2. **Data Integrity**: Strict constraints prevent phantom data
3. **Audit Everything**: Complete financial data traceability  
4. **Future-Proof**: Ready for authentication, admin panels, mobile
5. **Performance Optimized**: Proper indexing for portfolio queries

### Schema V2 Highlights

#### **10 Core Tables** (vs current 37 chaotic tables)
```
📊 users (18 columns)           - Multi-user auth & preferences
📊 accounts (16 columns)        - Brokerage account management  
📊 instruments (17 columns)     - Unified symbol/option catalog
📊 positions (19 columns)       - Current holdings (clean)
📊 transactions (23 columns)    - Complete trade history  
📊 tax_lots (18 columns)        - Accurate cost basis tracking
📊 market_data (16 columns)     - Price & technical indicators
📊 alerts (14 columns)          - User notification system
📊 sync_history (13 columns)    - Data sync audit trail
📊 audit_logs (12 columns)      - Complete change tracking
```

#### **Key Improvements**
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate transactions/positions
- **Cascade Deletes**: Proper relationship cleanup
- **Check Constraints**: Enforce business rules (quantity > 0, etc.)  
- **Comprehensive Indexes**: Optimized for portfolio queries
- **JSON Fields**: Flexible metadata without schema changes
- **Proper Enums**: Type safety for status fields

## 🔄 **MIGRATION STRATEGY**

### Phase 1: Data Extraction (Week 1)
```sql
-- Extract current good data
✅ TastyTrade Holdings (clean)
✅ TastyTrade Transactions (accurate)  
✅ IBKR Current Positions (verified)
⚠️ IBKR Historical CSV (user will provide)
❌ Current Tax Lots (discard - rebuild from transactions)
```

### Phase 2: Schema Creation (Week 1)
```bash
1. Backup current database
2. Create new V2 schema in parallel  
3. Validate all constraints and relationships
4. Create migration scripts for data transformation
```

### Phase 3: Data Migration (Week 2)
```python
# Priority Order:
1. Create default user account
2. Migrate brokerage accounts (IBKR + TastyTrade)
3. Import all instruments (stocks + options)
4. Load clean transaction history
5. Rebuild tax lots from transaction data  
6. Calculate current positions from transactions
7. Validate all discrepancies are resolved
```

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing (Week 2)  
```python
# Critical Validations:
✅ Zero tax lot discrepancies
✅ Position quantities match transaction balances
✅ All foreign key relationships valid
✅ No orphaned records
✅ Performance benchmarks met
```
